The Federation of Students, representing the __number of coop students__ 
affected, protests CECA’s decision to increase co-op fees without consultation
of student union representatives and student groups on campus. 

Further, the Federation of Students is opposed to any increase in co-op fees
prior to the completion of the Co-op Fee Deep-Dive analysis investigating the
need for, and impact of, any such increases; and proposes a hiatus on any
changes to co-op fees until the completion of the deep-dive investigation.

The Federation of Students requests decisions regarding changes in fees are
conducted in a more transparent manner involving continuous dialogue with
students. In particular, the failure to inform student representatives about
fees increases until less than 24 hours prior to the Co-operative Education
Council (CEC) meeting, and for failing to inform the general student body
before moving the agenda item to Board of Governors for approval is 
unacceptable and counter to the idea of collegial governance that this 
institution claims to uphold. 

The Federation of Students, while acknowledging the UW Staff Association’s
"Memorandum of Agreement: Staff Compensation 2015-2018" requested an increase
in staff salaries, notes that fee increases borne by students above the annual
Consumer Price Index adjustment should have approval-in-principle by elected
student representatives.
