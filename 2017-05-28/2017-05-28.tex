\section*{Executive Reports}

Please see the attached written reports for the full reports from the Executive
Board to Student's Council. 

All executive's spent this month preparing for their terms, including hiring 
their staff and creating their individual annual plans for the term.

\heading{Report of the \pres}
\begin{information}

    The \pres\ noted that construction on the expansion to the Student Life
    Centre and Physical Activites Complex had begun, and that all students had
    recieved an email detailing how they would be affected. A ground-breaking
    ceremony is being planned for June 19, 2017 and the \pres\ will be 
    co-hosting with President Bruce of the Graduate Students Association. 
    
    The \pres\ also touched on some of the plans they were making for the year,
    as well as the positive advocacy relationships that had already begun. 

    As an example, Premier Kathleen Wynne came to campus to promote the new 
    PharmaPlus plan. The \pres\ also took the opportunity to also discuss the 
    governments roll in preventing sexual violence on campus; a follow up 
    meeting was scheduled to discuss the matter in more depth.

    More locally, the \pres\ was invited to a police task force on sexual 
    violence and how it affects students. 

    Finally, the \pres\ highlighted that some work had begun on the new
    President's Advisory Commitee on Mental Health, and that Student's Council 
    could expect more updates at future meetings. 

\end{information}

\heading{Report of the \vpi}
\begin{information}

    The \vpi\ also made note of the work happening in the University related
    to student mental health, including that there would be plenty of 
    opportunities for Councillors to get their constituents active in the 
    discussion. 
    
    In addition, the \vpi\ is involved in a wellness committee that is 
    investigating how partners on campus are working towards a culture of 
    wellness on campus. The goal is to have all of the stakeholders working
    together in a unified direction. 
    
    In terms of student life,  the \vpi\ spent time learning more about the 
    clubs and services ecosystem, and has determined some termly goals for the 
    services as well as ensuring that the club support team has the 
    necessary resources to excel in their roles. 

    Finally, the \vpi\ will be investigating potential renovations to 
    the multi-faith prayer space to differentiate it from a classroom 
    and make it more accomodating.

    A councillor inquired about the Federation's plans to increase interaction
    with the student societies, and was informed that the \vpi\ is attending 
    the society executive meetings, organizing lunch and learns with the
    society executives, and increasing the role of the Committee of Presidents
    within their portfolio. 
    
\end{information}

\heading{Report of the \vpe}
\begin{information}

    The \vpe\ provided an update on the co-op fee review process that
    was promised as part of their platform. Meetings with the Director of Coop
    are proceeding and the terms of reference for the fee review committee are 
    being discussed.

    In addition to their university advocacy, the \vpe\ attended a conference 
    held by the \ousa\ and was elected President. They anticipate that this 
    will assist them in achieving the goals of the Federation in concert with 
    those of the \ousa.

    Finally, the \vpe\ shared their desire to improve the Federation's policy 
    framework with research and evidence to support existing policy, and
    they encouraged councillors to contact them to discuss any policy
    they felt the Federation was lacking. In response to a question from 
    Student's Council, the \vped\ also expressed that a large amount of the 
    Federation's policy is expired or expiring in the near future, and that
    councillors and their consituents could find the Federation's policies
    and their expiration dates online.

\end{information}

\heading{Report of the \vpof}
\begin{information}

    Beginning with the commercial services, the \vpof\ highlighted that there
    was an increase in traffic to Bomber and plans for a new menu. 
    As well, they announced that the selection of hot items at iNews had 
    increased, stocking three hot meals a day and Campus Bubble
    now serves chocolate ice cream and twist cones. 

    Internally, the new website encountered some unexpected issues
    with its backend but will be launched soon. 

    Finally, the \vpof\ drew attention to the recent government announcement
    on subsidized access to medication. 
    They are working closely with StudentCare to determine how the 
    Federation's health insurance plan will change with the new Pharmacare
    Plus program. A current lack of details about the
    plan is making it difficult to arrive at long-term sustainable decisions. 
    At the moment, fees haven't changed for the health and dental plan; until 
    more details are released the plan will operate as usual. 

\end{information}

\heading{Speaker's Report}
\begin{information}

    Given that no Speaker has been appointed, there was no formal report 
    submitted for this meeting; however, \printSpeaker\ highlighted the
    need for councillors to attend meetings and that council policy 
    stated that councillors may be removed after two un-excused absenses or
    four excused absenses.
